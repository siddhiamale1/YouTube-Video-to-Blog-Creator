# YouTube-Video-to-Blog-Creator
This GenAI application based project leverages the OpenAI models to convert the video data to a written blog format. The project involves leveraging CrewAI and OpenAI to automate the process of converting YouTube videos into written blog articles. CrewAI can assist in transcribing the audio from videos into text format, while OpenAI can then be used for summarizing and structuring this text into cohesive blog posts. This automated workflow aims to streamline content creation by harnessing AI technologies for efficient and scalable production of written content from video sources.
